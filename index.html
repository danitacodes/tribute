  <div>  <p> Breonna Taylor, known as "Bre" to her friends and family, was originally from Michigan. She moved to Louisville when she was a teen. She comes from a large, tightknit family.
She regularly spent time with her family where she could be found playing her favorite card games, Phase 10 and Skip-Bo.</p>
    <p> Breonna was an EMT. Her family say she's been attracted to the health care field for as long as they can remember. Breonna really cared about people and wanted to make a difference in someone's life.</p>
    <p> Everything changed on March 13! On that day, Breonna was ripped away from everyone who loved her. Police officers Jonathan Mattingly, Brett Hankison, and Myles Cosgrove entered her apartment with a "no-knock" search warrant. Breonna and her boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, were rudely awakened. Walker believed someone was breaking into their house and armed himself. Walker shot an officer in the leg and the other officers opened fire with more than 20 rounds strking Breonna at least 8 times.</p>
    <p>There are too many issues with the police report and the investigation is bringing forth some damning evidence into the real reason why the officers were there.<p></div>
